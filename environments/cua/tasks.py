"""Task definitions for the CUA environment.

`hud eval tasks.py` and `hud sync tasks` collect the public `tasks` list. Add a task by
calling `cua_task(...)`, setting a `.slug`, and adding it to the list. Verify a CUA env with a
real `hud eval tasks.py claude --runtime hud` rollout - the rfb desktop cannot run on macOS.
The multi-step research task wants more steps:

    hud eval tasks.py claude --task-ids shannon-multistep-research -y --max-steps 100
