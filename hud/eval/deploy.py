"""Platform builds for an environment's build context: the wire sequence.

Deploying is upload → trigger → await: the context goes to object storage, the
platform builds the image and introspects what it serves, and the build's lock
comes back. This module owns that exchange and nothing else — the counterpart
to :mod:`hud.eval.sync`, which owns the row exchange.

What a *directory* is called, which environment it is linked to, and what a
person watching is told are the CLI's concerns (:mod:`hud.cli.deploy`). Core
is handed a name and a context and reports what the platform did; it reads no
project configuration from the caller's tree and writes nothing there.
