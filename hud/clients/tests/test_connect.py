"""``connect()`` readiness: the handshake retries until the env actually serves.

A provisioned substrate can sit behind a proxied port (``docker -p``, a
port-forward) that *accepts* TCP before the env behind it is up — those
connections die with EOF at the handshake. Readiness is therefore
protocol-level: ``connect`` keeps retrying through both refused connects and
handshake EOFs until ``hello`` answers or the deadline passes.
