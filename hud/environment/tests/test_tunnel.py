"""Capability tunneling: environment daemons reached through the control port.

A capability address belongs to the environment's network. The raw manifest
retains that address for processes executing there, while the client binding
points at a local forwarder. Each connection to it becomes one fresh connection
to the control port, opened with a ``tunnel.open`` preface frame and spliced raw
to the daemon. The preface is transport-level routing — a connection is a stream
or a control session from its first frame, never upgraded mid-session. These
tests drive that path end to end against a served env fronting a real TCP echo
server.
