    A lazily-started worker drains up to ``batch_size`` queued calls (or waits up to
    ``max_wait_s`` for stragglers — which avoids stalling when fewer rollouts are live,
    e.g. the tail of a suite), stacks them into one ``[N, ...]`` batch, runs a single
    forward, and scatters the ``[N, T, A]`` rows back to each caller.

    ``inner`` must be an in-process, stateless model whose :meth:`~Model.infer` runs the
    whole ``[N, ...]`` batch in one forward (e.g. :class:`~hud.agents.robot.model.LeRobotModel`).
    :class:`~hud.agents.robot.model.RemoteModel` is **not** supported: it does one WebSocket
    request per env and the OpenPI server protocol has no batched-request shape, so a stacked
    batch would be mis-sent as a single env. Run one agent per rollout against it instead.
