"""The ``Model``: wraps a policy and owns its inference mechanics.

A ``Model`` knows *how to run* a policy (preprocess → forward → postprocess); the
harness only awaits ``model.ainfer(batch)``. Use :class:`LeRobotModel` for stock
LeRobot checkpoints; subclass :class:`Model` and implement ``infer`` otherwise.

:meth:`Model.infer` is batch-shaped (one batch dict in, an ``[N, T, A]`` chunk out) and
stateless across calls, so one model can be shared and batched across concurrent rollouts
(see :mod:`hud.agents.robot.batching`); per-episode state belongs on the agent.
